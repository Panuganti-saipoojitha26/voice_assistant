# voice_assistant
This is a Python-based Voice Assistant that listens to your commands and responds with audio feedback. It can tell the time, date, jokes, and can open applications like Visual Studio Code, Chrome, YouTube, and your file manager. The assistant is designed to be safe and responsive to your voice while ignoring background noise as much as possible.
